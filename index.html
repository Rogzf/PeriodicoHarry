            <i><b>When darkness overspreads my eyes</b></i><br>
            <div class="subtitulobloque1"><p>by JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE</p></div><br>
            <p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface
                of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I
                throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream;
                and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of
                the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the
                insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the
                breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of
                bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my
                soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh,
                would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm
                within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!</p>

            <br>
            <div class="subtitulobloque2"><p>The crowd seemed to grow</p></div><br>
            <p>The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd far away on the left, towards
                Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards
                Chobham dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

            <i class="subimg">Hermine hoping for courage.</i>
            <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking
                also helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon
                the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the
                cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and
                advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the
                pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.

                Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs
                and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards
                of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of
                whom was waving a white flag</p>

            <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I have traced the Rebel
                spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

            <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
            <div class="segundosubbloque3"><b>"Don't under­estimate the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke."</b></div><br>
            <p>This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as
                luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

                You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer
                to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p>

            <h3>IT WASN'T A DREAM</h3><br>
            <div class="subtitulobloque5"><p><i>by</i> FRANZ KAFKA</p></div><br>
            <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
                horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
                brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to
                cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</p>
            <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
                looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a
                little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay
                spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he
                had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady
                fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole
                of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>
